Created by [leafia](https://github.com/ntmleafia) and [movblock](https://github.com/mlbv). Huge thanks to mov for helping a lot to kickstart this addon!<br>
Developed mostly alone, so the mod's highly unstable. Not recommended to use on servers, but you can if you want to.

## Cursed Edition Overview

It adds exclusive features such as DFC rework, RBMK-like PWRs, the LFTR, and countless smaller features such as nuclear explosion VFX and SFX, more control panel support, rad classification, and more.

### Notes

The addon lacks an in-game version number system, so make sure you check on new releases every time you play!

# ALWAYS READ "DANGERS UPDATING WORLDS" ON GITHUB RELEASES WHEN UPGRADING THIS ADDON, UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND A CATASTROPHIC REACTOR FAILURE!

Requires [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter).

I recommend you to install [Backups](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/backups) if you're playing this addon.

I'll try to keep this up to date with Leafia's mod<br>
I can't spend too much time coding due to school, so some of the custom code is written by deepseek, this may be looked down upon, but i don't care!<br>
Feel free to contribute to this mod by creating pull requests.<br>
I might introduce some suggestions from Leafia's [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CKfuXcjRve)
